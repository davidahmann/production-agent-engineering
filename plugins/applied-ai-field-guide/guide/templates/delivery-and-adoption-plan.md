# Delivery and Adoption Plan

Use for one customer or internal workflow. Name the eventual service owner at pilot entry. If the building team will retain ownership, record that decision, operating capacity, and backup coverage; use the handoff exercises to test continuity rather than inventing a transfer to another team.

## Delivery contract

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Workflow charter and version | — |
| Initial segment and maximum effect | — |
| Accepted outcome and verifier | — |
| Delivery lead | — |
| Operational/product owner | — |
| Technical and service owner | — |
| Risk and data owners | — |
| Target pilot and production dates | — |
| Pilot graduation decision and evidence-cutoff dates | — |
| Pilot adoption owner and instrumentation-ready date | — |
| Receiving harness owner and paired-operation start | — |
| Primary sponsor / independent backup / succession trigger | — |
| Continuation mechanism, owner, and decision date | External renewal / internal funding or sponsorship / other |
| Stop conditions | — |

## Proof participation and decision capacity

Name the people whose evidence or decision is required before committing the proof. Record real availability and a delegate or escalation path; a title alone is not capacity. If a required contribution cannot be secured, narrow, defer, or stop the proof instead of treating the missing owner as a later adoption issue.

| Role or decision right | Required contribution | Availability window or decision deadline | Primary | Delegate or backup | Access/evidence required | If unavailable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sponsor and continuation decision | — | — | — | — | — | Escalate / narrow / defer / stop |
| Workflow or process ownership | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| Operator or domain judgment | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| Data and policy authority | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| Metric ownership and independent verification | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| Technical and receiving-service ownership | — | — | — | — | — | — |

Participation needs are target-specific. Practitioner time estimates or staffing patterns are evidence leads, not defaults. Control: `FDE-003`.

## Requirement-to-release trace

| Requirement | Domain/state | Context/logic | Tool/effect | Security | UX/artifact | Eval | Telemetry | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |

## Field contribution boundary

Classify each material field-built asset before implementation. The classification does not authorize the change; it binds the work to an owner and the destination's normal engineering, security, release, support, and lifecycle path.

| Asset or change | Contribution path | Contribution rights | Authoritative repo/runtime | Required review and release path | Production/support owner | Reuse-rights decision | Migration, exit, or retirement evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| — | Customer configuration / target-owned extension / shared product or platform / time-bounded experiment / prohibited or deferred | Independent / collaborative / destination-owner only / none | — | — | — | Cleared / restricted / pending / prohibited | — |

For product or platform work, use the destination team's normal codebase, architecture, security, testing, release, telemetry, on-call, and maintenance standards. A temporary parallel service is a potential shadow product and MUST name its production ceiling, expiry, migration or destruction path, and blocking gate. `FDE-004`, `DEL-001`, `OPS-003`.

## Proof-work ledger

A proof is a decision instrument, not a miniature transformation program. Link each material activity to at least one inspectable output; otherwise record why the work remains necessary or stop it.

| Activity | Evidence used | Output class | Output or artifact | Owner | Decision or next move |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| — | — | Decision / tested assumption / working increment / sanitized reusable learning | — | — | — |

Reusable learning is not automatically a reusable asset. Confidentiality, ownership, permission, sanitization, destination review, exact versioning, and target validation still apply.

## Milestones

| Milestone | Demonstrable vertical slice | Entry evidence | Exit evidence | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Discovery complete | Charter and observed cases | Sponsor and operator access | Approved bounded workflow | — |
| Architecture complete | End-to-end design and threat paths | Charter | Contracts, tests, rollback design | — |
| Sandbox complete | Representative trigger through verified simulated effect | Versioned fixtures | Contracts and negative cases pass | — |
| Shadow complete | Real inputs, no production effect | Trace and reviewer capacity | Outcome, safety, cost, UX thresholds | — |
| Canary complete | Named segment and reversible/staged effect | On-call and rollback | SLO, adoption, value, recovery evidence | — |
| Bounded production | Supported service | Service ownership exercised | Review cadence and expansion decision | — |

## Pilot graduation contract

Freeze this contract before pilot work begins. A pilot graduates only when each applicable gate passes independently; a strong technical result or composite score cannot average away failed adoption, value, economics, safety, or operating ownership.

| Gate | Named segment and threshold | Evidence source and cutoff | Decision owner | If the gate fails |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Technical performance | — | — | — | Revise / stop |
| Operator acceptance | — | — | — | Redesign workflow or surface / stop |
| Adoption | — | — | — | Remove friction / narrow segment / stop |
| Business-value evidence | — | — | — | Extend measurement once with reason / defer / stop |
| Full economics | — | — | — | Reduce cost or scope / defer / stop |
| Production readiness | — | — | — | Hold release / remediate / stop |

| Graduation field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Approved pilot start and maximum duration | — |
| Allowed evidence extension and approver | None / one bounded extension with reason and date |
| Resulting charter or release decision | — |
| Graceful exit, state disposition, and restart conditions | — |

Control: `FDE-003`.

## Adoption measurement contract

Freeze this contract before pilot entry. Changes to the denominator, event definition, window, or source create a new measurement revision and require a documented rebaseline.

| Adoption metric | Eligible denominator and exclusions | Baseline value / as-of / status | Target | Guardrail and limit | Measurement window | Authoritative event/query source and revision | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |

Record the identity-deduplication rule, late-event policy, timezone, missing-data behavior, and segment keys used to calculate the metric.

### Baseline acknowledgment

Before the baseline supports a proof decision, the metric owner and verifier acknowledge the exact revision, source, exclusions, disputes, and rebaseline conditions. Preserve disagreement instead of editing it away. This is a governed measurement acknowledgment, not legal advice or a substitute for an applicable contract.

| Metric and revision | Source and as-of date | Metric owner | Independent verifier | Acknowledged at | Disputed assumptions or exclusions | Rebaseline trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| — | — | — | — | — | — | — |

## Adoption funnel and friction review

Use one cohort, window, and metric revision across the funnel. Every count must reconcile to its authoritative event/query source; do not infer a missing stage from downstream activity.

| Funnel stage | Declared event or query | Eligible count / reached count / rate | Leading failure reasons from representative cases | Owner and dated response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Eligible opportunity | — | — | Eligibility, source quality, policy, or segment exclusions | — |
| Exposed in the usable surface | — | — | Routing, access, integration, latency, or missing context | — |
| Completed or explicitly dispositioned | — | — | Workflow placement, surface friction, trust, training, or fallback | — |
| Independently accepted | — | — | Evidence, behavior, correction, rejection, policy, or authority | — |
| Verified business effect | — | — | Wrong bottleneck, weak baseline, downstream rework, or attribution | — |
| Sustained net value | — | — | Reviewer load, support, recovery, incidents, or full cost | — |

Define bounded reason codes from observed cases and preserve an open-text escape hatch. Sample non-use and abandonment; do not classify silence as user resistance without checking access, routing, data, timing, and the current manual path.

## Adoption rehearsal and cohort sequence

| Step | Representative users and cases | Entry evidence | Exercise | Exit evidence or stop condition | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Observe current work | — | Recent cases and process knower | Trace the current artifact, waits, workarounds, escalation, and recovery | Current path and operator burden are evidenced | — |
| Access and surface rehearsal | — | Final role and representative fixture | Sign in, find the case, inspect evidence, correct, reject, escalate, and resume | Critical action or access friction is resolved | — |
| Assisted shadow | — | Frozen adoption contract and instrumentation | Operator uses the surface while the current path remains authoritative | Funnel events reconcile and no blocking safety or workflow gap remains | — |
| Operator-led bounded cohort | — | Support capacity and rollback ready | Operators lead; delivery team observes and records reason codes | Thresholds and guardrails pass, or cohort is constrained/stopped | — |
| Receiving-team-led cohort | — | Named service, training, access, and support owners | Receiving team enables users, supports cases, reproduces metrics, and leads review | Exercised capability supports handoff decision | — |

## Review and support capacity

| Capacity | Forecast demand and burst | Available capacity and hours | Queue/wait limit | Overflow or degraded path | Owner | Evidence and decision |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Domain review | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| User support and training | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| Incident and reconciliation | — | — | — | — | — | — |

Do not expand a cohort when adoption success would exceed review, support, or recovery capacity. A named person is not capacity evidence; exercise the forecast peak, wait limit, overflow path, and escalation.

## Adoption design

| User group | Eligible segment | Current job and artifact | New surface | Benefit | New responsibility | Training | Feedback channel | Adoption contract row |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |

The production surface must expose evidence, state, uncertainty, alternatives, and permitted actions. Users must be able to correct, pause, reject, escalate, and resume work without losing the audit trail.

## Working adoption loop

Use a short, recurring working session while the workflow is changing. This is a way to make adoption work visible. It does not replace support, incident handling, source/policy decisions, or release authority.

| Participants | Bring | Decide or produce | Owner and due date | Evidence destination |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Workflow owner; one or two operators/reviewers; service or delivery owner; data or policy owner when needed | One current case; one observed friction, metric, or support theme; one proposed response | Preserve, repair, remove, escalate, or test one bounded response | — | Support record / field observation / backlog item / policy decision / change or release record |

When a short demonstration helps, show the prior path, changed path, one correction or exception, and what still needs evidence. Do not present a demonstration, attendance, or positive feedback as adoption, accepted outcome, or realized value.

## Stakeholder value and productization boundary

| Audience | Outcome or workday benefit | New responsibility | Acceptance evidence | Customer-specific or reusable | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Executive or operational sponsor | | | | Customer-specific | |
| Operator or domain expert | | | | Customer-specific | |
| Product or applied-AI team | | | | Reusable only after governed validation | |

Keep confidential workflow context, local policy, identities, and evidence with the owning organization. A repeated field signal may become a shared pattern or product candidate only after sanitization, recurrence review, a named destination, independent validation, and the normal compatible-release gate. Record that decision in the [field-learning register](field-learning-register.md). `FDE-004`, `DEL-002`.

## Sponsor, owner, and continuation resilience

| Role or decision | Primary | Independent backup | Last evidence-backed review | Succession or escalation trigger | Next decision date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Business outcome and continuation | — | — | — | — | — |
| Operational ownership | — | — | — | — | — |
| Technical/service ownership | — | — | — | — | — |
| Risk acceptance | — | — | — | — | — |

For an external engagement, continuation may be a deployment, renewal, or expansion decision. For an internal team, it may be sponsorship, funding, or roadmap commitment. Record it as organizational context; it does not prove accepted outcomes or realized value.

## Pilot adoption and harness handoff

Open this workstream at pilot entry. The accountable operating team pairs on the actual harness, evaluation, release, support, and adoption paths before bounded production. When the same team builds and runs the service, its designated backup leads the continuity exercises.

| Capability | Pilot exercise | Delivery owner | Operating owner | Start / owner-led date | Evidence | Blocking gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Harness configuration and bounded run | Trace one representative run from admission to terminal state | — | — | — | — | — |
| Behavior change | Review a model, prompt, context-policy, tool-bundle, or guardrail diff | — | — | — | — | — |
| Evaluation and case authoring | Add and execute a representative and a negative case | — | — | — | — | — |
| Adoption instrumentation | Reproduce numerator, denominator, exclusions, and guardrail from source | — | — | — | — | — |
| Release and rollback | Promote an isolated compatible release and restore the prior version | — | — | — | — | — |
| Alert, containment, and reconciliation | Run a game day using the production route and source-of-truth readback | — | — | — | — | — |
| User support and feedback triage | Resolve a pilot support case and classify the resulting learning | — | — | — | — | — |
| Adoption diagnosis and response | Diagnose one funnel break from representative cases and deliver the owned product, access, training, or operating response | — | — | — | — | — |

Controls: `FDE-003`, `ADP-002`, `DEL-001`, `OPS-007`.

## Artifact ownership and lineage

| Artifact/release role | Authoritative URI | Version or digest | Upstream inputs and revisions | Producing path | Change owner | Receiving owner | Access/retention | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Workflow charter and value contract | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| Domain/data/context contract | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| Agent harness and behavior bundle | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| Tool, identity, and policy contracts | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| Evaluation suite and report | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| User surface and support assets | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| Runtime, telemetry, runbooks, and release manifest | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |

Each production release resolves these rows to immutable versions or digests; aliases such as `latest` do not establish lineage.
