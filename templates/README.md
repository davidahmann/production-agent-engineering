# Working Templates

Copy the smallest set needed for one workflow, replace the example values with evidence from the target environment, and keep the artifacts together under version control. A valid template is a structural starting point, not production evidence.

## Validate as the decision matures

The repository uses one canonical schema per governed artifact. The `starter` profile checks only the decision-bearing fields needed now while retaining the canonical schema's types and closed-object rules; it does not create a second “lite” contract. The `complete` profile requires the full canonical structure and semantic invariants.

```bash
npm run validate:artifact -- ./path/to/workflow-start.json --profile starter --type workflow-charter
npm run validate:artifact -- ./path/to/workflow-charter.json --profile complete
```

Supported progressive types are `workflow-charter`, `engagement-reframe`, and `data-context-manifest`. Use `--json` for machine-readable results. Run `npm test` before treating a repository change as complete. Passing artifact validation proves structure and declared invariants only; it does not supply missing field evidence, authority, acceptance, or release approval.

Complete validation supports all 22 governed JSON types, including tools, evaluations, change assessments and solution releases. Run `npm run validate:artifact -- --help` for the fixed local type list; use `--type evaluation-report` when a saved file has an arbitrary name. Files may live outside the clone. Artifact-supplied schema URLs are never fetched or executed. Single-artifact validation uses shared semantic checks where defined, but does not resolve referenced files or verify signatures and external authority; cross-artifact release checks remain in the repository or target-system release gate. `starter` is deliberately unavailable for other types.

### Why progressive profiles stop at JSON contracts

Starter profiles apply only to closed, machine-readable contracts whose canonical JSON Schema can retain type and unknown-field rules while requiring a smaller decision-bearing subset. The Markdown delivery, readiness, and handoff templates are collaborative working records: their tables carry target evidence, exercises, dissent, owners, and narrative decisions that cannot be made true by structural validation. Converting them to JSON merely for symmetry would create worse human artifacts and another contract surface to maintain.

Use their minimum viable sections progressively instead:

| Decision | Start with | Add before the next gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Plan a pilot | Delivery contract, pilot graduation contract, adoption measurement contract, and adoption design | Funnel diagnosis, cohort sequence, capacity, artifact lineage, and prototype debt |
| Assess rollout readiness | Assessment identity, status contract, applicable readiness rows, and blocking gaps | Target-system tests, operating evidence, rollout decision, and restoration evidence |
| Start transfer | Ownership, pilot transfer plan, open capability gaps, and temporary support boundary | Receiving-team-led exercises, immutable artifact lineage, post-exit support, and acceptance decision |

Repository tests verify that these canonical sections, control references, and links remain present. That is a structural guardrail, not evidence that a target team filled the record, exercised the path, or accepted the decision. Keep these documents in the pilot packet from the start and deepen the same files; do not create separate “starter” Markdown copies.

For a first workflow conversation, start with these twelve decision-bearing fields. This is the same workflow-charter object you will extend later, so no conversion or parallel “lite” artifact is required.

```json
{
  "workflow_id": "invoice_exception_resolution",
  "owners": {
    "operational": "accounts-payable",
    "risk": "finance-controls",
    "receiving_service_owner": "accounts-payable-service"
  },
  "functional_requirement": {
    "user": "accounts-payable reviewer",
    "decision": "select the policy-covered resolution",
    "accepted_outcome": "approved resolution matches ledger readback"
  },
  "scope": {
    "initial_segment": "domestic price-variance exceptions",
    "out_of_scope": ["payment execution"]
  },
  "outcome": { "verifier": "finance controls manager" },
  "stop_conditions": ["source authority cannot be verified"],
  "decision": { "disposition": "discover" }
}
```

Run it with `--profile starter`. As evidence matures, add fields from the canonical [workflow-charter template](workflow-charter.json) and switch to `--profile complete`. The same progressive path works for a contradicted [engagement reframe](engagement-reframe.json) and a decision-bound [data-context manifest](data-context-manifest.json); validation errors name the next missing decision field.

| [Field-learning register](field-learning-register.md) | Which recurring field signal becomes a customer fix, platform change, documented pattern, or rejected proposal |

The current evaluation-report and solution-release JSON contracts are model/agent release profiles. A deterministic, optimization, or classical-ML-only system should use the target software release process with equivalent versioned data, model/code, policy, evaluation, operations, rollout, rollback, and ownership evidence; do not invent an agent system merely to satisfy these templates.

Follow the full sequence in the [delivery playbooks](../playbooks/README.md). JSON artifacts declare a local schema and are checked by `npm run validate`.
